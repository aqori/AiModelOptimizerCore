# AiModelOptimizerCore

## Description

A hybrid neural network architecture combining graph attention mechanisms with symbolic reasoning, enabling explainable AI for complex relational data and supporting incremental learning through online structural updating.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the AiModelOptimizerCore software project:
- "Optimizes neural network architectures using Bayesian optimization and gradientbased search",
- "Supports automated hyperparameter tuning for deep learning models using grid search and random search",
- "Provides model pruning and knowledge distillation techniques to reduce model size and latency",
- "Implements gradientbased explainability methods for model interpretability and feature importance analysis",
- "Offers realtime model performance monitoring and alerting for drift detection and concept shift identification",
- "Includes automated model ensemble construction and stacking for improved predictive performance",
- "Supports model serving and deployment on cloud, edge, and onpremise environments using containerization"
- Let me know if you need any adjustments!
